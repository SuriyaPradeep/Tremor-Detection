This project uses Mediapipe and deep learning to detect tremors associated with Parkinson's disease from video data. Mediapipe's hand tracking technology captures real-time hand movements, while a deep learning model analyzes these movements to identify tremors indicative of Parkinson's. The system aims to provide an accurate, non-invasive method for early detection and monitoring of Parkinson's tremors.
